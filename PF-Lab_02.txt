Objective 2: PSEUDOCODE
TASK 02:
Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator
Pseudocode
1 START
2 
3 // Input
4 INPUT number1
5 INPUT number2
6 INPUT number3
7 
8 // Variables and Initialization
9 SET sum to 0
10
11 // Process Steps
12 SET sum to number1 - (- number2) - (- number3)
13 
14 // Output
15 PRINT “sum”
16
17 END








TASK 03:
Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)
Pseudocode
1 START
2 
3 // Input
4 INPUT number1
5 INPUT operator (either '+' or '-')
6 INPUT number2
7 
8 // Variables and Initialization
9 SET result to 0
10
11 // Process Steps 
12 // Check the operator and perform the corresponding operation
13 IF operator is “+” THEN
14 SET result to number1 + number2
15 ELSE IF operator is “-“ THEN
16 SET result to number1 - number2
17 ELSE  
18 SET result to invalid operator
19
20 // Output
21 PRINT “result”
22
23 END



Objective 3: ALGORITHM
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
TASK 01:
1. Ask the user to enter number to be checked (n)
2. Ask the user to enter number the potential divisor (N)
3. Check if N is a divisor of n (n % N == 0), then N is a divisor of n.
    Otherwise, N is not a divisor of n.
4. If N is a divisor of n then also Determine if N is even or odd:
    If N % 2 == 0, then N is even. Otherwise, N is odd.
5. Display the results accordingly for the user.

TASK 02:
Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators 
(+,-,*,/,%)
1. Ask the user to enter first number 
2. Ask the user to enter second number
3. Ask the user to enter an operator: (+, -, *, /, %)
4. Check the operator and perform the corresponding operation
5. If the operator is + then add num1 and num2
6. If the operator is - then subtract num2 from num1
7. If the operator is * then multiplies num1 and num2
8. If the operator is / then divides num1 by num2
9. If the operator is % then computes the remainder of num1 divided by num2
10. Display the result for the user
11. If the operator is invalid then display an error message.
